/find_plan_file ## Summary

I've successfully created a comprehensive feature specification document for the Form content type. Here's what was accomplished:

### Work Completed:

1. **Researched the Codebase** - Analyzed the Personal Compass Platform structure, including:
   - Existing course/lesson architecture
   - Quiz implementation as a reference pattern
   - Database schema and content type system
   - Three-layer architecture (actions → services → repositories)
   - Component structure and patterns

2. **Analyzed Similar Features** - Studied the Quiz implementation to understand:
   - Database schema patterns (quiz.ts)
   - Service layer structure
   - Server actions with authentication
   - Builder and Renderer component patterns
   - Results viewing functionality

3. **Created Comprehensive Specification** - Wrote a detailed plan at:
   **`/home/joshnewton/Development/clarify-your-compass/specs/form-content-type.md`**

### Key Specification Highlights:

**Feature Overview:**
- TypeForm replacement for anonymous feedback collection
- Support for 4 question types: text entry, multiple choice, multiple answer, Likert scale
- One question per page with progress bar
- Anonymous by default, no points/scoring
- Facilitator results dashboard with AI insights

**Implementation Approach:**
- **21 detailed step-by-step tasks** ordered from foundation to integration
- Follows existing quiz architecture pattern (forms → submissions → responses tables)
- Three-layer architecture: Repository → Service → Actions
- Separate components for Builder (admin), Renderer (student), and Results (facilitator)

**Comprehensive Coverage:**
- Database schema design (new `forms.ts` schema file)
- Complete file structure with 13 new files and 3 updated files
- Testing strategy (unit, integration, edge cases)
- 17 acceptance criteria for feature completion
- 12 validation commands (automated + manual tests)
- Future feature considerations (skip logic, public URLs, advanced analytics)

The specification is ready for implementation and follows the project's existing patterns and architectural conventions.
