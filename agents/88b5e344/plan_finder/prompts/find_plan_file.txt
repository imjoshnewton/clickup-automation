/find_plan_file I can see this project is focused on automation workflows for ClickUp/GitHub, not a course management platform. The feature request appears to be for a different project (one with course management functionality). However, I need to clarify with you:

**This repository (`clickup-automation`) is an automation workflow system for triggering AI development workflows via GitHub Issues or ClickUp Tasks.** It doesn't contain:
- Course management functionality
- Student/facilitator roles
- Content types like quizzes or forms
- The files mentioned (ViewCourse.tsx, EditCourse.tsx, ContentRenderer.tsx)

The feature request describes building a "Form" content type for what appears to be a **learning management system (LMS)** or **course platform**, but this is a **webhook automation repository**.

**Questions:**
1. Is this feature request intended for a different repository/project?
2. Should I create a plan for implementing this feature in a hypothetical course platform based on the patterns I can infer?
3. Or would you like me to explain the mismatch between the feature request and this codebase?

Could you clarify which repository this feature should be implemented in? If you'd like me to proceed with creating a plan anyway (perhaps as a template for use elsewhere), I can do that, but it won't be specific to this codebase since the necessary infrastructure doesn't exist here.
